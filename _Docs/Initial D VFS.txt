// ### Initial D Virtual File System - VFS - For general use (*.BIN)

Notes:
Writeup example based on data\memscene\saveicon_r.bin
VERY GOOD for debuggung of the VFS (Contains two normal pngs)

  Initial D PSP Header - XBB(?):
    0x00-03 = Identifier "XBB" (58 42 42)
    0x04 = Unknown flags (01)
	0x05 = integer File Count (1 byte)
    0x06-1F = Empty space for the rest of the header

   Initial D PSP VFS (0x20-7F), always 4 byte chunks???
	0x20-23 = 1.File bytearray Start Pointer
	0x24-27 = 1.File bytearray End-Pointer (start + endpointer = pointer to end of file)
	0x28-2B = 1.File Pointer for filename string (0x0h is used as string seperator)
	0x2C-2F = 1.File Some kind of gay crc? 
		-File1: C2 EE 09 00
		-File2: 4C A0 58 CE
	
	[...] File2...
	[...] Block of unknown Data | always 8 byte Chunnk pro file! (0x0 - 0x7)
	
	Note: VFS Metadata Header is always per file 0xF Long (0-15 Bytes)

// ### Container Format For Graphics and shared Palettes (*.ANA)

Note: is pretty much the same as bin VFS, but dosent has crc codes, (and it seems that the filename length is limited)

  Initial D PSP Header - ANA:
    0x00-03 = Identifier "@ANA" (40 41 4E 41)
    0x04 = ??? (default 16)
	0x05-07 = Empty
	0x08-0B = ??? (not static, changes in every ana file)
	0x0C = Empty
	0x0D = Unknown Flag (always 01)
	0x0E-0x0F = Empty
	0x10 = File Count
    0x14-1F = Empty space for the rest of the header

  Initial D PSP ANA (0x20-7F), always 4 byte chunks???
	0x20-23 = 1.File bytearray Start Pointer
	0x24-27 = 1.File bytearray End-Pointer (start + endpointer = pointer to end of file)
	0x28-2F = 1.File Filename string (value 0x00 at the end as seperator)
	
	Files have an ANA Part at the end? It seems for me, that it contains a one big palette that is shared for all indexed files
	Palette seems to be GIM Compatible title\logo.bin\PSP_SEGALOGO.ana contains only one file with one palette at the end!
	If you remove the Begining header, programms like Noesis recognize it and display it successfully with all colors!
	
Note:
Graphic file is layer based
Header for one layer is 0x0-0xAF Long

// ### PSP/Initial D Image Format *.GIM something like 16x16

Notes:
Seems to be 5:6:5 16 bit (no alpha?, color key alpha)
Format for a Pallete Based Graphic Picture
Seems to be a successor to the PSX .TIM

  Initial D PSP Header - MIG(?):
    0x00-0A = Identifier "MIG.00.1PSP" (4D49472E30302E31505350) (Big endian to Little = GIM.1.00PSP)
    0x0B-F = Empty
	0x10- = integer File Count (1 byte)
    0x06-1F = Empty space for the rest of the header
	
	bei logo : gegen ende E3 Hex maske = pallette
